## Instructions
This exercise involves finishing a set of functions to perform specific tasks. When running `functions.js` your code should output what's in the `output.txt` file.

1. Make sure to **Sync Fork** on GitHub, so your repo is up-to-date and has a `exer3` folder
2. Pull the new changes onto your local repo (`git pull origin main`)
3. Open the `functions.js` file. This is where you will write your code.
4. You will see several functions with descriptions commented at the top. Write your code inside the function that fullfils the function's description.
5. Please don't delete any of the starter code from the `functions.js` file, only add.
6. Run your code by navigating into the correct directory in Terminal or Git Bash and enter the command `node functions.js`
7. If the output matches  `output.txt`, your solutions are correct and you can push your changes to GitHub to gain points.
